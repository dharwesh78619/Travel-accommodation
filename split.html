<h1>Some random text on the left</h1>
<p>The human eye is a slightly asymmetrical sphere with an average diameter of the length of 20mm to 25mm. <br>It has a volume of about 6.5cc.<br> The eye is just like a camera. The external object is seen as the camera<br> take the picture of any object. Light enters the eye through a small hole<br> cal<br>led the pupil, a black looking aperture having the quality of contraction<br> of eye when exposed to bright light and is focused o<br>n the retina which is like a camera film. 

    The lens, iris, and cornea are nourished by clear fluid, know as anterior chamber. The fluid flows from ciliary body to the pupil and is <br>absorbed through the channels in the a<br>ngle of the anterior chamber. The delicate balance <br>of aqueous production and absorption controls pressur<br>e within the eye. 
    
    Cones in eye number between 6 to 7 million which are highly sensitive to colors. Human visualizes the colored image in daylight due to the<br>se <br>cones. The cone vision is<br> also called<br> as photopic or bright-light vision. 
    <br>
    Rods<br> in the eye are much larger between 75<br> to 150 million and are distributed over the retinal<br> surface. Rods are not involved in the color vision and are sensitive <br>to low levels of illumination.

    Image Fo<br>rmation in the Eye: 
    When the len<br>s of the eye focus an image of the o<br>utside world onto a light-sensitive membrane in the b<br>ack of the eye, called retina the image is formed.<br> The lens of the eye focuses light on the phot<br>oreceptive cells of the retina which detects the p<br>hotons of light and responds by producing neural impul<br>ses. </p>
